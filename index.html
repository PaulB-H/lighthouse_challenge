        <pre>
Dot's measuring the sizes of all the different holes in the roof. They need to know how much material to purchase to patch them up. Can you help them?

Dot needs you to look at the measurements and figure out the answers to the following questions:

Small hole (less than 20 mm) 	$1.30
Medium hole (above or equal to 20 mm AND less than 70mm) 	$1.60
Large hole (above or equal to 70 mm) 	$2.10

What is the average sized hole?
What is the average cost to fix a hole?
What is the total cost of fixing all of the holes?

# Stretch Question:
# What is the maximum sized hole?
# What is the minimum sized hole?
        </pre>
        <pre><code>import random 
import pandas as pd

random.seed(34)

hole_sizes = [random.randint(1, i) for i in range(1, 101)]
random.shuffle(hole_sizes)

# Turn hole_sizes into a 'series' Pandas can work with
hole_series = pd.Series(hole_sizes)

# What is the average sized hole?
average_size_hole = hole_series.mean()
print(f'Average sized hole is {average_size_hole}')

# What is the average cost to fix a hole?
cost_list = []

for i in range(len(hole_sizes)):
	if hole_sizes[i] < 20:
		cost_list.append(1.30)
	elif hole_sizes[i] < 70:
		cost_list.append(1.60)
	else:
		cost_list.append(2.10)
        
# Turn cost_list into a 'series' Pandas can work with
cost_series = pd.Series(cost_list)

avg_cost_per_hole = round(cost_series.mean(), 3)
print(f'Average cost to fix a hole is ${avg_cost_per_hole}')
    
# What is the total cost of fixing all of the holes?
total_cost = round(sum(cost_list), 3)
print(f'Total cost to fix all holes is ${total_cost}')

# Stretch Questions:

# What is the maximum sized hole?
max_hole_size = hole_series.max()
print(f'Max hole size is {max_hole_size}')

# What is the minimum sized hole?
min_hole_size = hole_series.min()

        <pre>
The store in the nearby town does sell cleaning supplies, but their prices can sometimes be a lot higher than Dot's used to. They've already spent so much money on repairs - can you help them figure out which supplies to abstain from buying at the town's store?

Dot's okay with paying a bit of a surplus for convenience, but they don't want to go broke buying dustpans and glass cleaner. Help them figure out which items cost over 10% more at the nearby store, so they can avoid buying these items.

The wording for this question was a bit tricky. In the previous challenge we had to figure out which prices at the city store were a certain % greater than the country store price.

Part of this challenge says:
"...The store in the nearby town does sell cleaning supplies, but their prices can sometimes be a lot higher than Dot's used to...."

We know from our data that Dot moved from the city to the country. Therefore we know we need to now find the items that cost more at the country store compared to the city store.

Dot's now happily mapped out exactly what supplies they'll need to make the repairs to their new rural abode. They're nearly breathless with anticipation, thinking about how incredible it's going to look! But first, they need to buy the paint and wood. There's so much Dot needs to purchase, they're unsure - should they buy the items at normal retail value, or wholesale?

Item / Needed Amount to Buy / Wholesale Price / Retail Price
Plank of Oak Wood         600 	$ 7000 	$ 12.99
1 Liter of Blue Paint 	  150 	$ 1000  $ 8.99
1 Liter of White Paint 	  15    $ 1000  $ 9.99
1 Liter of Paint Finish   165 	$ 800 	$ 3.99
        </pre>
        <pre><code>item_list = ['Oak Wood', 'Blue Paint', 'White Paint', 'Paint Finish']

amount_list = [600,150,15,165]

wholesale_price_list = [7000, 1000, 1000, 800]

retail_price = [12.99, 8.99, 9.99, 3.99]

for i in range(len(item_list)):
    retail_cost = amount_list[i] * retail_price[i]

    print(f'{item_list[i]} would cost {retail_cost} retail')

    print(f'{item_list[i]} would cost {wholesale_price_list[i]} wholesale')

    if retail_cost > wholesale_price_list[i]:
          print(f'{item_list[i]} is cheaper wholesale \n')
    else:
          print(f'{item_list[i]} is cheaper retail \n')

# returns: 
# Oak Wood is cheaper wholesale
# Blue Paint is cheaper wholesale
# White Paint is cheaper retail
# Paint Finish is cheaper retail
